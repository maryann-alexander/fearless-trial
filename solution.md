Project Purple Cow

How to build and run this application:
In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`

The start command runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

What I would change:
Improvements to this proof of concept would include better design. The simplicity of the application limits the styling choices we could make but increasing the size of the button and changing the color and typeface are a start. We would also benefit by making that a reusable component for when we want to add features. Currently the entire scope of the application is captured within the App.js but the benefit of using React is that we could scale this up with reusable components and the built in methods of the countapi are incredibly handy. I do believe that for scaling up this application and adding features, React is the best choice.  For the future it could be nice to have a reset button or a counter for how often a feature is used or something is downloaded, though that may be data the end user doesn't care to see. Once the direction for the project is established and we know who are users are, it will be easier to flesh out ideas for updates and improvements.
